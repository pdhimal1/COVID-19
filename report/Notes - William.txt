Notes for CS 584 Semester Project
---------------------------------

- Probably want to compare other models (UW, etc.). See FiveThirtyEight article for this.
  - Compare the model itself (what are they modeling and we are not, and vice-versa)
  - Also compare predictions.
 
- Probably want to do some verification on OUR model.
  - Try to calculate the transmission rate up until 2 weeks ago (for example). Use the same method to make predictions, and compare against the real data.

- SEIR model. Incorporate test results? (Total tests, % of positive and negative)

- What is the effect of different averaging methods?
  - SMA vs Gaussian, etc.

- Better graphing!
  - Show graphs with extrapolated transmission rates
  - Show graphs with predictions
  - Show graphs for each country and comparing countries, etc.


- 

- Extrapolations
  (1a) Trending to 0
  (1b) Opposite of trending to 0
  (2) Constant 7 day average
  (3) Reverse of the last 30 days
  (4) Trending to max


- Validation
  - Convert x-axis labels to "index (date label)"
  
  
  
Left To Do 5/18/2020
====================
1. Update report with analysis.
2. Add code to use scikit optimizer to solver for best beta and gamma!
   - What countries had the highest and lowest values?
3. Structure predictions according to these dimesions:
   a) Beta smoothing factor (2.5 is what I've been using)
   b) Number of days in the past to use for the prediction. Usually 1 - 60 days or so.
   c1) Number of samples points within this interval to use for the the prediction (subsampling)
       - step by 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 points
   c2) Maybe a weight scheme for the points - (memory factor)
   d) Method of extrapolation: Trained on NN, constant value, linear model, quadratic?
   e) Extrapolation method for beta value. Fill in method is (linear vs. quadratic)
      - Talk about this. We assume that the true beta function is sort of smooth. Probably a bad assumption.

4. Graph the changes across each dimension. Find the best one, report on SSE, make future predictions.

5. Repeat analysis for gamma.



Ideas for report:
 - Outline the intuition behind the beta and gamma parameters.
   - How do the things that we hear about (social distancing, contact tracing, bed count, etc.) influence these parameters?
 - 

- Beta representation - absolute vs. multiplied by N.
