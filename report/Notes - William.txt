Notes for CS 584 Semester Project
---------------------------------

- Probably want to compare other models (UW, etc.).
  - Compare the model itself (what are they modeling and we are not, and vice-versa)
  - Also compare predictions.
 
- Probably want to do some verification on OUR model.
  - Try to calculate the transmission rate up until 2 weeks ago (for example). Use the same method to make predictions, and compare against the real data.

- SEIR model. Incorporate test results? (Total tests, % of positive and negative)

- What is the effect of different averaging methods?
  - SMA vs Gaussian, etc.

- Better graphing!
  - Show graphs with extrapolated transmission rates
  - Show graphs with predictions
  - Show graphs for each country and comparing countries, etc.
