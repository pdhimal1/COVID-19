# Predicting the Impact of COVID-19

#### Why Investigate COVID-19?
 * COVID-19 is a now a major global pandemic and is having a major impact on peopleâ€™s lives around the globe.
 * There is significant uncertainty about what the effects the pandemic will be going forward.
 * Large amounts of data have been collected as the spread of Covid-19 has progressed. Using data mining techniques to attempt to predict likely outcomes will support the task of building an appropriate and effective response strategy.

#### Primary Project Goal:
For this project, we will construct a model showing how cases of COVID-19 will spread around the globe. Our main focus will be on accurately predicting the number of infections, fatalities, and recoveries we should expect, along with what the time frame is for these events to unfold.

#### COVID-19 Data Sources
##### Primary Data Source:
Our primary data source for mapping the global spread of COVID-19 will be the data provided by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE). This contains day-by-day time series data, broken down by country and region.
